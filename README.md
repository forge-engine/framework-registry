# 🎞️ Forge Framework Vault

Hey there! 👋

This repo is basically the **time capsule** for the Forge Framework. Every version I release gets dropped here, so if you ever want to go back in time, compare changes, or grab a specific version—this is the place.

This is also where the `php framework.php` script looks when you run something like:

```bash
php framework.php install
```

Or:

```bash
php framework.php install 0.1.1
```

So yep, this is the official vault of every Forge release. Nothing fancy, just a tidy shelf of versions, ready whenever you need them.

Forge is a personal project first—no pressure, no bloat, no hype. Built for builders who want full control. If it helps you too, awesome. Fork it, remix it, break it apart.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙌
