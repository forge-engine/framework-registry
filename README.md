# ðŸ“¦ Forge Framework Vault!

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ So, this is where all the different versions of the Forge Framework live. Think of it like a little archive or a time capsule for each release I've put out.

Basically, if you ever need to look back at a specific version of Forge, maybe to see how things changed or even to grab an older release for some reason, this is the place to be.

And here's a little secret: this is actually where the `php framework.php` script looks when you tell it to install the latest version of Forge, or a specific version you choose. So, it's kind of the official storage for all things Forge releases! ðŸ˜‰

It's pretty simple â€“ just a collection of all the Forge versions, nice and organized. Feel free to have a peek around! ðŸ˜Š
